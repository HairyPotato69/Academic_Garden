> This is my *personal* academic garden, use it as you see fit

I'm [HairyPotato69](https://github.com/HairyPotato69). This is my **digital garden** to record my academic journey throughout my Computer Science Degree. I've started this garden not long ago, so, for now, there are only a few *plants* - basic ideas and content. But hey, it's a fresh start, and I will nurture and grow my garden over time.

I don't apply any popular systematic way of making notes. 
I do not own or claim these notes or information as my own. They are taken from online sources, books, lectures, and tutorials reimagined into my own words and thoughts. 

If you don't know where to look for sources, this digital garden can guide you.
