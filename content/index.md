> This is my *personal* academic garden, use it as you see fit

I'm [HairyPotato69](https://github.com/HairyPotato69). This is my **digital garden** to record my academic journey throughout my Computer Science Degree. I've started this garden not long ago, so, for now, there are only a few *plants* - basic ideas and content. But hey, it's a fresh start, and I will nurture and grow my garden over time.

I don't apply any popular systematic way of making notes. I keep my notes in sequential order under headings subheadings. 

I do not own or claim these notes or information as my own. They are taken from online sources, books, lectures, and tutorials.
